IFN-gamma is a master regulator of the immune responses that occur in the transplanted kidney , acting both on the immune system and on the graft itself .	[]
The cellular responses to IFN-gamma are complex , and emerging evidence suggests that IFN-gamma may regulate autophagic functions .	[]
Conversely , autophagy modulates innate and adaptive immune functions in various contexts .	[]
In this study , we identify a novel mechanism by which IFN-gamma activates autophagy in human kidney epithelial cells and provide new insights into how autophagy regulates immune functions in response to IFN-gamma .	['resisting cell death', 'tumor promoting inflammation']
Our results indicate that IFN-gamma promotes tryptophan depletion , activates the eIF2alpha kinase general control nonderepressible-2 ( GCN2 ) , and leads to an increase in the autophagic flux .	['resisting cell death']
Further , tryptophan supplementation and RNA interference directed against GCN2 inhibited IFN-gamma-induced autophagy .	['resisting cell death']
This process is of functional relevance because autophagy regulates the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors by human kidney epithelial cells in response to IFN-gamma .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
These findings assign to IFN-gamma a novel function in the regulation of autophagy , which , in turn , modulates IFN-gamma-induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines .	['resisting cell death', 'tumor promoting inflammation']

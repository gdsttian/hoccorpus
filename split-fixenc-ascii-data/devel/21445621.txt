BACKGROUND Hesperidin , a flavanone present in citrus fruits , has been identified as a potent anticancer agent because of its proapoptotic and antiproliferative characteristics in some tumor cells .	[]
However , the precise mechanisms of action are not entirely understood .	[]
AIM The main purpose of this study is to investigate the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPARgamma ) in hesperidin's anticancer actions in human pre-B NALM-6 cells , which expresses wild-type p53 .	[]
METHODS The effects of hesperidin on cell-cycle distribution , proliferation , and caspase-mediated apoptosis were examined in NALM-6 cells in the presence or absence of GW9662 .	[]
The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPARgamma ) , p53 , phospho-IkappaB , Bcl-2 , Bax , and XIAP proteins were focused on using the immunoblotting assay .	[]
The transcriptional activities of PPARgamma and nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) were analyzed by the transcription factor assay kits .	[]
The expression of PPARgamma and p53 was analyzed using the RT-PCR method .	[]
RESULTS Hesperidin induced the expression and transcriptional activity of PPARgamma and promoted p53 accumulation and downregulated constitutive NF-kappaB activity in a PPARgamma-dependent and PPARgamma-independent manner .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
The growth-inhibitory effect of hesperidin was partially reduced when the cells preincubated with PPARgamma antagonist prior to the exposure to hesperidin .	[]
CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study clearly demonstrate that hesperidin-mediated proapoptotic and antiproliferative actions are regulated via both PPARgamma-dependent and PPARgamma-independent pathways in NALM-6 cells .	['resisting cell death']
These data provide the first evidence that hesperidin could be developed as an agent against hematopoietic malignancies .	[]

BACKGROUND NFkappaB signaling is of paramount importance in the regulation of apoptosis , proliferation , and inflammatory responses during human development and homeostasis , as well as in many human cancers .	[]
Receptor Tyrosine Kinases ( RTKs ) , including the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors ( FGFRs ) are also important in development and disease .	[]
However , a direct relationship between growth factor signaling pathways and NFkappaB activation has not been previously described , although FGFs have been known to antagonize TNFalpha-induced apoptosis .	[]
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Here , we demonstrate an interaction between FGFR4 and IKKbeta ( Inhibitor of NFkappaB Kinase beta subunit ) , an essential component in the NFkappaB pathway .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
This novel interaction was identified utilizing a yeast two-hybrid screen [ 1 ] and confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis .	[]
We demonstrate tyrosine phosphorylation of IKKbeta in the presence of activated FGFR4 , but not kinase-dead FGFR4 .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Following stimulation by TNFalpha ( Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha ) to activate NFkappaB pathways , FGFR4 activation results in significant inhibition of NFkappaB signaling as measured by decreased nuclear NFkappaB localization , by reduced NFkappaB transcriptional activation in electophoretic mobility shift assays , and by inhibition of IKKbeta kinase activity towards the substrate GST-IkappaBalpha in in vitro assays .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
FGF19 stimulation of endogenous FGFR4 in TNFalpha-treated DU145 prostate cancer cells also leads to a decrease in IKKbeta activity , concomitant reduction in NFkappaB nuclear localization , and reduced apoptosis .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Microarray analysis demonstrates that FGF19 + TNFalpha treatment of DU145 cells , in comparison with TNFalpha alone , favors proliferative genes while downregulating genes involved in apoptotic responses and NFkappaB signaling .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE These results identify a compelling link between FGFR4 signaling and the NFkappaB pathway , and reveal that FGFR4 activation leads to a negative effect on NFkappaB signaling including an inhibitory effect on proapoptotic signaling .	[]
We anticipate that this interaction between an RTK and a component of NFkappaB signaling will not be limited to FGFR4 alone .	[]

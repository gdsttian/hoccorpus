Identification of the proteins that are associated with estrogen receptor ( ER ) status is a first step towards better understanding of the hormone-dependent nature of breast carcinogenesis .	[]
Although a number of gene expression analyses have been conducted , protein complement has not been systematically investigated to date .	[]
Because proteins are primary targets of therapeutic drugs , in this study , we have attempted to identify proteomic signatures that demarcate ER-positive and -negative breast cancers .	[]
Using highly enriched breast tumor cells , replicate analyses from 3 ERalpha+ and 3 ERalpha- human breast tumors resulted in the identification of 2,995 unique proteins with >=2 peptides .	[]
Among these , a number of receptor tyrosine kinases and intracellular kinases that are abundantly expressed in ERalpha+ and ERalpha- breast cancer tissues were identified .	[]
Further , label-free quantitative proteome analysis revealed that 236 proteins were differentially expressed in ERalpha+ and ERalpha- breast tumors .	[]
Among these , 141 proteins were selectively up-regulated in ERalpha+ , and 95 proteins were selectively up-regulated in ERalpha- breast tumors .	[]
Comparison of differentially expressed proteins with a breast cancer database revealed 98 among these have been previously reported to be involved in breast cancer .	[]
By Gene Ontology molecular function , dehydrogenase , reductase , cytoskeletal proteins , extracellular matrix , hydrolase , and lyase categories were significantly enriched in ERalpha+ , whereas selected calcium-binding protein , membrane traffic protein , and cytoskeletal protein were enriched in ERalpha- breast tumors .	[]
Biological process and pathway analysis revealed that up-regulated proteins of ERalpha+ were overrepresented by proteins involved in amino acid metabolism , proteasome , and fatty acid metabolism , while up-regulated proteins of ERalpha- were overrepresented by proteins involved in glycolysis pathway .	['cellular energetics']
The presence and relative abundance of 4 selected differentially abundant proteins ( liprin-alpha1 , fascin , DAP5 , and beta-arrestin-1 ) were quantified and validated by immunohistochemistry .	[]
In conclusion , unlike in vitro cell culture models , the in vivo signaling proteins and pathways that we have identified directly from human breast cancer tissues may serve as relevant therapeutic targets for the pharmacological intervention of breast cancer .	[]

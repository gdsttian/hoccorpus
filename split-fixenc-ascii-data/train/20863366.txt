INTRODUCTION IkappaB Kinase epsilon ( IKKepsilon ) is a member of the IKK family which plays an important role in the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) .	[]
Overexpressed in over 30% of breast cancers , IKKepsilon has been recently identified as a potential breast cancer oncogene .	[]
The purpose of this study is to examine the therapeutic potential of IKKepsilon siRNA on human breast cancer cells .	[]
METHODS Eight siRNAs targeting different regions of the IKKepsilon mRNA were designed , and the silencing effect was screened by quantitative real time RT-PCR .	[]
The biological effects of synthetic siRNAs on human breast cancer cells were investigated by examining the cell proliferation , migration , invasion , focus formation , anchorage-independent growth(via soft agar assay ) , cell cycle arrest , apoptosis ( via annexing binding ) , NF-kappaB basal level , and NF-kappaB related gene expressions upon the IKKepsilon silencing .	[]
RESULTS Silencing of IKKepsilon in human breast cancer cells resulted in decrease of focus formation potential and clonogenicity as well as in vitro cell migration/invasion capabilities .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Moreover , knockdown of IKKepsilon suppressed cell proliferation .	[]
Cell cycle assay showed that the anti-proliferation effect of IKKepsilon siRNA was mediated by arresting cells in G(0)/G(1) phase , which was caused by down-regulation of cyclin D(1) .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Furthermore , we demonstrated that silencing of IKKepsilon inhibited the NF-kappaB basal activity as well as the Bcl-2 expression .	[]
Significant apoptosis was not observed in breast cancer cells upon the silencing of IKKepsilon .	['resisting cell death']
The present study provided the first evidence that silencing IKKepsilon using synthetic siRNA could inhibit the invasiveness properties and proliferation of breast cancer cells .	[]
CONCLUSIONS Our results suggested that silencing IKKepsilon using synthetic siRNA may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for breast cancer .	[]

Regulation of adaptive immunity by innate immune cells is widely accepted .	[]
Conversely , adaptive immune cells can also regulate cells of the innate immune system .	[]
Here , we report for the first time the essential role of B cells in regulating macrophage ( Mphi ) phenotype .	[]
In vitro B cell/Mphi co-culture experiments together with experiments in transgenic mice models for B-cell deficiency or overexpression showed B1 cells to polarize Mphi to a distinct phenotype .	[]
This was characterized by downregulated TNF-alpha , IL-1beta and CCL3 , but upregulated IL-10 upon LPS stimulation ; constitutive expression of M2 Mphi markers ( e.g .	[]
Ym1 , Fizz1 ) and overexpression of TRIF-dependent cytokines ( IFN-beta , CCL5 ) .	[]
Mechanistically , this phenotype was linked to a defective NF-kappaB activation , but a functional TRIF/STAT1 pathway .	[]
B1-cell-derived IL-10 was found to be instrumental in the polarization of these Mphi .	[]
Finally , in vivo relevance of B1-cell-induced Mphi polarization was confirmed using the B16 melanoma tumor model where adoptive transfer of B1 cells induced an M2 polarization of tumor-associated Mphi .	[]
Collectively , our results define a new mechanism of Mphi polarization wherein B1 cells play a key role in driving Mphi to a unique , but M2-biased phenotype .	[]
Future studies along these lines may lead to targeting of B1 cells to regulate Mphi response in inflammation and cancer .	['tumor promoting inflammation']

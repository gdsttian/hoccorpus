Estrogens play essential roles in the progression of mammary and prostatic diseases .	[]
The transcriptional effects of estrogens are transduced by two estrogen receptors , ERalpha and ERbeta , which elicit opposing roles in regulating proliferation : ERalpha is proliferative while ERbeta is anti-proliferative .	[]
Exogenous expression of ERbeta in ERalpha-positive cancer cell lines inhibits cell proliferation in response to estrogen and reduces xenografted tumor growth in vivo , suggesting that ERbeta might oppose ERalpha's proliferative effects via formation of ERalpha/beta heterodimers .	[]
Despite biochemical and cellular evidence of ERalpha/beta heterodimer formation in cells co-expressing both receptors , the biological roles of the ERalpha/beta heterodimer remain to be elucidated .	[]
Here we report the identification of two phytoestrogens that selectively activate ERalpha/beta heterodimers at specific concentrations using a cell-based , two-step high throughput small molecule screen for ER transcriptional activity and ER dimer selectivity .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Using ERalpha/beta heterodimer-selective ligands at defined concentrations , we demonstrate that ERalpha/beta heterodimers are growth inhibitory in breast and prostate cells which co-express the two ER isoforms .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Furthermore , using Automated Quantitative Analysis ( AQUA ) to examine nuclear expression of ERalpha and ERbeta in human breast tissue microarrays , we demonstrate that ERalpha and ERbeta are co-expressed in the same cells in breast tumors .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
The co-expression of ERalpha and ERbeta in the same cells supports the possibility of ERalpha/beta heterodimer formation at physio- and pathological conditions , further suggesting that targeting ERalpha/beta heterodimers might be a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of cancers which co-express ERalpha and ERbeta .

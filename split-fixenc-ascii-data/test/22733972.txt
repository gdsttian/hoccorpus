Elevated phosphorylation of estrogen receptor alpha ( ERalpha ) at serines 118 ( S118 ) and 167 ( S167 ) is associated with favorable outcome for tamoxifen adjuvant therapy and may serve as surrogate markers for a functional ERalpha signaling pathway in breast cancer .	[]
It is possible that loss of phosphorylation at S118 and/or S167 could disrupt ERalpha signaling , resulting in aggressive ERalpha-independent breast cancer cells .	[]
To this end , MCF-7 breast cancer cells were stably transfected with an ERalpha-specific short hairpin RNA that reduced endogenous ERalpha .	[]
The resulting cell line was stably transfected with wild-type ERalpha ( ER-AB cells ) , or ERalpha containing serine to alanine mutation at S118 or S167 ( S118A cells and S167A cells , respectively ) .	[]
These stable cell lines expressed approximately equivalent ERalpha compared with parental MCF-7 cells and were evaluated for growth , morphology , migration/invasion , and ERalpha-regulated gene expression .	[]
S118A cells and S167A cells exhibited increased growth and migration/invasion in vitro .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Forward- and side-scatter flow cytometry revealed that S167A cells were smaller in size , and both S118A and S167A cells exhibited less cellular complexity .	[]
S118A and S167A cells expressed pancytokeratin and membrane localization of beta-catenin and did not express vimentin , indicating retention of epithelial lineage markers .	[]
Expression of ERalpha-target genes and other genes regulated by ERalpha signaling or involved in breast cancer were markedly altered in both S118A and S167A cells .	[]
In summary , attenuated phosphorylation of ERalpha at S118 and S167 significantly affected cellular physiology and behavior in MCF-7 breast cancer cells , resulting in increased growth , migration/invasion , compromised expression of ERalpha target genes , and markedly altered gene expression patterns .

The apoptotic effects of interferon lambdas ( IFNlambdas ) have been described in several types of cancers .	[]
However , their effects on human lung cancer cells and the mechanisms are elusive .	[]
In addition , the interaction between IFNlambdas and other interferons remains unclear .	[]
The interplay between IFNalpha and IFNlambda has been reported .	[]
However , although IFNgamma is a well-known regulatory interferon , the mechanisms through which it regulates IFNlambdas in lung cancer cells are unknown .	[]
These issues are critical for the application of IFNlambdas in lung cancer therapy .	[]
In this study , we used A549 , a cell line derived from a human lung carcinoma , to characterize the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of IFNlambdas on lung cancer , and the interplay between IFNgamma and IFNlambda .	[]
Because overexpression of full-length ectopic IFNlambdaR1 led to cell death , we generated A549 cells stably expressing a chimeric receptor ( 10R1/lambdaR1 ) , which is composed of the extracellular domain of IL-10 receptor ( IL10R1 ) fused in tandem to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the IFNlambda receptor ( IFNlambdaR1 ) .	[]
By comparing with A549 cells stably expressing its cognate vector , we demonstrated that IL-10 stimulation triggered the intracellular IFNlambda signaling via 10R1/lambdaR1 receptor .	[]
By using A549 cells expressing 10R1/lambdaR1 , we report that the IFNlambdaR1 chain of IFNlambda receptor possesses an intrinsic ability to trigger apoptosis in human lung cancer cells .	[]
Although it did not suppress cell proliferation , IFNlambda signaling via 10R1/lambdaR1 receptor induced cell cycle arrest , externalization of phosphatidylserine , DNA fragmentation , activation of caspase-3 , caspase-8 and caspase-9 .	['resisting cell death']
However , the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK did not prevent apoptosis .	['resisting cell death']
In addition , the extent of induced apoptosis correlate with the expression levels of the IFNlambda receptor and the levels of STAT1 activation .	[]
Lastly , we demonstrated that IFNgamma sensitized A549 cells to IFNlambda-induced apoptosis , via upregulation of IFNlambdaR1 .	[]
These data indicate the potential of IFNlambda , alone or in combination with IFNgamma , in the treatment of human lung carcinoma .	[]

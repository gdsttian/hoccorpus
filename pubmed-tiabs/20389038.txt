Relationship between DNA repair and formation of sister chromatid exchanges and chromatid aberrations under the influence of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition by 3-aminobenzamide.
The mechanisms of formation of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and chromosome aberrations following inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by 3-aminobenzamide were studied in Chinese hamster ovary cell lines deficient in different repair pathways. The results confirm earlier findings that (a) the 'spontaneous' SCEs are formed due to the incorporated BrdU in the DNA, (b) 'spontaneous' and induced SCEs originate from different mechanisms, and (c) SCEs and chromatid exchanges are formed by different pathways.

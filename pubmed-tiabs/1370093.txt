p53 shares an antigenic determinant with proteins of 92 and 150 kilodaltons that may be involved in senescence of human cells.
A panel of primary human cells and virus-transformed derivatives were tested for events that coincide with immortalization. In all primary and precrisis cells, two proteins of 92 and 150 kDa that shared an epitope with p53 were found; in most of their immortalized derivatives, however, they were absent. Expression of these proteins may be involved in senescence.
